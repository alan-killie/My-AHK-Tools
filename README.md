🛠️ My-AHK-Tools
"I have no idea what I'm doing. I'm just vibing and making scripts so my computer behaves the way I want."

Welcome to my collection of AutoHotkey (v2) scripts. Most of these were born out of a minor annoyance that I decided to spend three hours "fixing" with code.

📋 What’s in here?
I’m organizing these by how they help me, mostly so I don't lose them:

/Windows-Util: General system tweaks.

ScrollOverTaskView.ahk: Switch virtual desktops by scrolling over the Task View button.

/App-Specific: Scripts that only exist because I needed a thing for a specific app.

🛠️ How to use these
Install AutoHotkey v2.

Download a script you like.

Double-click it.

If it breaks, try and fix it.

⚠️ The "I'm Just Vibing" Disclaimer
These scripts work on my machine. If they summon a demon on yours or make your computer sentient, that's between you and the code. I'm learning as I go, so expect:

Variable names that make sense only at 2 AM.

Occasional "Invalid variable declaration" errors that I eventually google my way out of.

Minimal logic, maximum vibes.
